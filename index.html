      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Software Engineering student at the Technical University of Moldova
        with hands-on experience in Java backend development through internships at
        Allied Testing and Grid Dynamics. I enjoy building scalable, well-architected
        systems using microservices and modern backend technologies.
        I aspire to become a specialized backend engineer with deep expertise in
        distributed systems and cloud-native development.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Technical University of Moldova</h3>
          <p>Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering (2022 – present)</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Favorite course:</strong> Algorithms and Data Structures —
            the course that sharpened my problem-solving mindset and gave me a
            solid foundation for writing efficient code.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pleasant memory:</strong> Attending the first hackathon
            organized by TUM, where my team built a small inventory management
            app in 24 hours — my first taste of real collaborative coding under
            pressure.

          <h3>Theoretical High School "Gaudeamus"</h3>
          <p>Mathematics and Computer Science profile (2018 – 2022)</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Favorite course:</strong> Computer Science — where I wrote
            my first programs in Pascal and fell in love with programming.
